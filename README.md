# Getting Started app for Discord
 
### Get app credentials

Fetch the credentials from your app's settings and add them to a `.env` file (see `.env.sample` for an example). You'll need your app ID (`APP_ID`), bot token (`DISCORD_TOKEN`), and public key (`PUBLIC_KEY`).

Fetching credentials is covered in detail in the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

> 🔑 Environment variables can be added to the `.env` file in Glitch or when developing locally, and in the Secrets tab in Replit (the lock icon on the left).

### Install slash commands

The commands for the example app are set up in `commands.js`. All of the commands in the `ALL_COMMANDS` array at the bottom of `commands.js` will be installed when you run the `register` command configured in `package.json`:

```
npm run register
```

### Run the app

After your credentials are added, go ahead and run the app:

```
node app.js
```

> ⚙️ A package [like `nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), which watches for local changes and restarts your app, may be helpful while locally developing.

If you aren't following the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started), you can move the contents of `examples/app.js` (the finished `app.js` file) to the top-level `app.js`.

### Set up interactivity

The project needs a public endpoint where Discord can send requests. To develop and test locally, you can use something like [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel HTTP traffic.

Install ngrok if you haven't already, then start listening on port `3000`:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

You should see your connection open:

```
Tunnel Status                 online
Version                       2.0/2.0
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000

Connections                  ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

Copy the forwarding address that starts with `https`, in this case `https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io`, then go to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

On the **General Information** tab, there will be an **Interactions Endpoint URL**. Paste your ngrok address there, and append `/interactions` to it (`https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io/interactions` in the example).

Click **Save Changes**, and your app should be ready to run 🚀

## Docker + Caddy (HTTPS)

The `docker-compose.yml` now includes a Caddy reverse proxy:
- `raid-helper` stays on internal HTTP over port `3333`
- `caddy` exposes `80/443` and terminates TLS
- the Discord app is published under the `/raid-helper` subpath

### Prerequisites

- A real public domain name pointing to your Raspberry Pi (`A`/`AAAA` DNS record)
- Ports `80` and `443` open to your Raspberry Pi

### Configuration

Add `DOMAIN` to your `.env` file with the public domain name pointing to your Raspberry Pi.

### Start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Discord URL

In the Discord developer portal, configure the interactions endpoint URL as:

```text
https://<your-domain>/raid-helper/interactions
```

Caddy automatically strips the `/raid-helper` prefix before proxying the request to the Node app, which can keep listening on `/interactions` internally.
